Python Application for various Training and Nutrition tasks
Python application for use by both clients and coaches at the gym I manage and coach out of. 
Functionality includes personalized Training Programing with set and rep ranges unique to each user. 
It also provides a macronutrient breakdown which is also unique to each user. 
These outputs are based on various factors such as age, bodyweight, height, gender and recent weights lifted.
This takes the guess work out of training and nutrition for clients and coaches alike, 
and saves them from doing tedious calculations over and over again.  
Planned functionality includes Android compatibility and SQL integration to house client data. 
I will continue to work on this throughout at least this first year of study.
